# BookMarker

## About
This is a static website meant to save and display bookmarks / URLs for me.  I access it via a file:/// link but it could easily be hosted anywhere...

The idea and the original skeleton code came from [Alex Chan](https://alexwlchan.net/) - specifically from [this post](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/mildly-dynamic-websites/).

## Usage
I personally check this out to a folder called "bookmarks" under my home directory on my Macbook.  Then I open my browser and go to file:///Users/chris/bookmarks/index.html
